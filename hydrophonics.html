        <p>In Project 3, the Kratky hydroponics method is employed to grow cabbage using recycled plastic water bottles and poultry manure as the nutrient source. The project begins with preparing the water bottles, which arecleaned to serve as mini reservoirs for the hydroponic system. Poultry manure is then processed and diluted to create a nutrient-rich solution that will nourish the plants. The cabbage seedlings are placed in directly securing the stem using folded wastepaper, which are suspended in the water bottles, allowing their roots to hang into the nutrient solution. Cabbage seedlings were placed in the system, but unfortunately, they did not survive due to the high concentration of nutrients. Recognizing the issue, the solution was further diluted, and balsam plants were introduced as an alternative. This time, the plants thrived, demonstrating the importance of nutrient balance in hydroponic systems. Over time, the plants grow without soil, sustained entirely by the hydroponic setup.</p>
        <p>This method addresses several major issues:</p>
        <div>
        <li>Plastic Bottles: By repurposing plastic bottles, we reduce waste and give new life to materials that would otherwise end up in landfills.</li>
        <li>Food Supply: Growing cabbage in a controlled environment helps increase food production and availability.</li>
        <li>Less Water Needed: Hydroponics uses less water than traditional soil farming, making it a more sustainable option.</li>
        <li>No Fancy Chemicals or Nutrients: Using poultry manure as a natural fertilizer reduces the need for synthetic chemicals.</li>
        <li>No Need for Soil: The Kratky method eliminates the need for soil, which is beneficial for areas with poor or contaminated soil. </li>
        </div>
       <p>This project highlights how STEM can be used to develop innovative solutions for environmental and food supply challenges.</p>
       <div>
        <li>S (Science): We study the biological needs of cabbage/balsam and how they can be met using hydroponics. This involves understanding how plants absorb nutrients from water and how poultry manure can be used effectively as a natural fertilizer.</li>
        <li>T (Technology): We use hydroponic technology to design and set up a system that allows cabbage/balsam to grow in plastic bottles. This includes using tools and materials to create a stable environment for the plants and ensuring that the nutrient solution is delivered properly.</li>
        <li>E (Engineering): Engineering principles are crucial in designing the hydroponic setup. We need to engineer a way to support the cabbage/balsam plants in the bottles and ensure that the system is efficient and durable.</li>
        <li>M (Mathematics): Mathematics is used to calculate the correct amount of poultry manure needed and to measure the water-to-nutrient ratio. We also use math to monitor and adjust the pH levels and nutrient concentrations in the system to ensure optimal plant growth.</li>
