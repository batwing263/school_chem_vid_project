        <p>Project 2 involves recycling paper to produce eco-friendly gift cards embedded with flower seeds, combining creativity with environmental consciousness. The process starts with collecting wastepaper from the printing room, which is then shredded and pulped. This pulp is mixed with water to form a slurry, which is then spread out to form a thick sheets. While the paper is still wet, flower seeds are carefully embedded into it, ensuring they will sprout when the card is planted. After the paper dries and hardens, it is cut into card-sized pieces and designed with messages or artwork. The final step involves testing the cards to confirm that the seeds will germinate successfully. This project not only promotes recycling but also encourages recipients to engage in planting, thus giving new life to the wastepaper.</p>
        <p>Most importantly, this project addresses two major global challenges:</p>
        <div>
            <li>Climate Change: By recycling paper, we reduce the need for new paper production, which in turn lowers deforestation rates and reduces carbon emissions. The embedded seeds, when planted, grow into plants that absorb carbon dioxide, further helping to combat climate change.</li>
            <li>Sustainability: This project promotes sustainability by giving wastepaper a new life as a product that not only avoids landfill but also contributes to the environment. The seeds embedded in the paper encourage people to plant more greenery, supporting a more sustainable future.</li>
        </div>
        <p>Our project shows how STEM can be a powerful tool in addressing these critical issues while creating something innovative and meaningful.</p>
        <div>
            <li>S (Science): We explore the properties of different types of paper and how they break down in soil. We also study which seeds will grow best when embedded in the paper.</li>
            <li>T (Technology): We use technology to create the right mixture of recycled paper pulp and embed the seeds evenly. This might involve using blenders to ensure the paper is durable but still capable of breaking down when planted.</li>
            <li>E (Engineering): Engineering comes into play as we design the process of embedding seeds into the paper without damaging them.</li>
            <li>M (Mathematics): We apply mathematics to calculate the optimal thickness of the paper and the number of seeds per card to ensure the best chance of growth.</li>
       </div>
       <p>This project is a great example of how STEM can turn waste into something beautiful and sustainable.</p>
